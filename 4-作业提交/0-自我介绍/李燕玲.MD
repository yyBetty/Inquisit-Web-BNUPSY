Hello~Mr.Wei,
My name is Lee Yin Ling.
I come from Hong Kong. A poem called‘The Road Not Taken’ by Robert Forst inspire me very much.
 Just to be fair, I was studying commercial in high-school (my elective subjects are economic, business, accounting and financial studies plus geography) but I am now studying psychology because I believe that I should take risk to challenge myself. 
That is why I came to Beijing.
I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
