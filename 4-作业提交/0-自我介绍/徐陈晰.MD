Hello ,my name is XU CHENXI.
I come from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian ,which only a few people know about .
Honestly I don't like working on computers and it makes me feel dizzy .
BNU is a beautiful place .I am glad I have been here to meet so many wonderful people and experience so many brilliant moments .
Uncertain about future and don't want to think about tomorrow ...
