 I am a lost boy from Neverland \
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan. \
And when we're bored we play in the woods. \
Always on the run from Captain Hook. \
"Run, run, lost boy," they say to me, "Away from all of reality."\
\
Neverland is home to lost boys like me And lost boys like me are free.\
\
\
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling. \
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect story book.\
Neverland, I love you so, You are now my home sweet home Forever a lost boy at last.\
\
And for always I will say\
