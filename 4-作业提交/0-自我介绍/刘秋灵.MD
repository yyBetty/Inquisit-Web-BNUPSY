"My fellow brothers, 
I stand here today, humbled by the task before us, 
mindful of the sacrifices by our niconico ancestors.  We are in the midst of crisis, 
niconico douga is at war against a full-region storm of disturbance and deletion.  Niconico's economy is badly weakened. 
A consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of management.
Today, I say to you, that the challenge is real. They are serious, and they are many. 
They will not be easily met or in a short span of time. But know the niconico: they will be met. 
In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never given, our journey has never been more of shortcuts. 
Our ancestors struggled and sarcrificed, so that we might live better. "
