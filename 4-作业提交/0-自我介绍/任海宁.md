Dear Dr.Wei
    I am Haining Ren, or Henin, a sophomore student from the school of psychology.For psychology, I have the overwhelming desire to study it
through, especially in the area of social psychology, cognitive psychology and criminal psychology. Talking about the reason why I choose 
this major, it is all about the curiosity I want to know the structure of the brilliant brain and the expectation to become a detective(criminal
psychology). In the programming area, I am, to be honest, a green hand. Besides the routine work, I have few hobbies. I like to be quiet alone sometimes.
So to some degrees I am not a social man. That's all myself.
    Hope we have a great journey in the next five weeks in programming. 
    Best Wishes!
                                                                                                                                   Yours,
                                                                                                                                   Henin
