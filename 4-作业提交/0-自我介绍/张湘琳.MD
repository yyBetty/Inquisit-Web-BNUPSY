Hi, teacher. I’m Sunny Zhang. A girl.
I was born in 1998, and my hometown is Chongqing.
I have no boyfriend but many good boy/girl-friends who make me happier.
I major in psychology.
Though I’m not smart, I love making program very much actually. Every time I finish something about program I’ll get a feeling of satisfaction. But it will also cost me much time. Hah. So, I won’t choose to major in Computer Science if I have another chance^.
I don’t know what I want to do now, even now. But I’ll go on.
